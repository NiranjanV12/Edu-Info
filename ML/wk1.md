## Definition
Arthur Samuel. He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.

Tom defines machine learning by saying that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows. He says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised Learining
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

graph of:
-  Age , Tumor size
- Cost, sqFeet

quadratic function, or a second-order polynomial to this data
Given some data points .....fill up in between

### Regression problem 
graph of Cost, sqFeet  By regression problem, I mean we're trying to predict a continuous valued output. Namely the price. 
### Classification problem
 graph of  Age , Tumor size(for benign or malignant) Discrete value o/p 1 or 0 - The term classification refers to the fact, that here, we're trying to predict a discrete value output zero or one, malignant or benign. It turns out that in classification problems, sometimes you can have more than two possible values for the output.

### Features  
-  Age , Tumor size
- Cost, sqFeet
- Infinite No of Features ? Load on Machine

## Unsupervised Learning

I--\n Unsupervised Learning, we're given data that looks different than data that looks like this that doesn't have any labels or that all has the same label or really no labels.
Given this data set, an Unsupervised Learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in two different clusters.
